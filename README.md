## Abstract
In an era where financial markets are increasingly influenced by algorithmic trading, this thesis presents a comprehensive study on the application of Reinforcement Learning in stock market trading. The project delves into the implementation and evaluation of various RL algorithms to develop an automated trading strategy.

We explore the efficacy of these models in navigating the complexities of the stock market, aiming to outperform traditional trading methods including the Markowitz model of portfolio optimization. The research leverages a decadeâ€™s worth of historical data, encompassing a diverse portfolio of nineteen distinct stocks spanning seven sectors. This approach provides a comprehensive testing ground to assess the RL models' capability under a range of market conditions, thereby offering a detailed understanding of their effectiveness in real-world stock trading scenarios. 

Our methodology involves training, testing, and optimization of the RL models, encompassing aspects such as hyperparameter tuning, policy architecture exploration, and learning rate adjustments. Additionally, the study integrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to investigate the effects of dimensionality reduction on the models' efficiency and performance. The models are evaluated based on their portfolio performance, risk-adjusted returns, and consistency across different market scenarios.

Significant findings of this research include insights into the adaptability of RL models to financial data, the impact of varying model architectures and parameters, and a comparative analysis of model performances. The study not only sheds light on the potential of RL in financial decision-making but also highlights the challenges and considerations pertinent to algorithmic trading.
